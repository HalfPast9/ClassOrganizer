# course scheduler
 python implementation of a script to find every possible schedule based on the given courses and the term.

 ## future updates to improve on the current product:
 - create a ui: probably use tkinter for this
 - json generator to create your own courses
 - options to edit existing courses to have it better match the current term offerings
 - ability to save multiple schedule sets (multiple per term)
 - maybe upgrade the current data storage solution to sql?
 - renovate codebase (isnt too big an issue now but as it grows bigger with all the proposed upgrades, will     
    snowball.)
